Notes
- The pageparser class has a constructor that accepts the CNN article URL as an example
- The parse() function currently separates parts of the article and prints them

Possible future enhancements -

- Separate the parsing and printing in to separate methods
- Testing on various types of CNN articles with different formats
- Move the PHP code into a separate file - and leave HTML in HTML - separate the model/view/controller aspects
- Use camel case or "PHP appropriate" case for variable and function names
- Specific classes for exception handling and logging
- Cover the DOM creation and HTML loading part with exceptions
